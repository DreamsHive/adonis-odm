# AdonisJS Package Refactor & Release Plan

This document outlines the tasks required to refactor, clean up, and prepare the AdonisJS package for release.

## Phase 1: Code Cleanup & Initial Refactoring

**Goal:** Improve code quality, remove clutter, and prepare for larger structural changes.

1.  **Automated Linting & Formatting:**
    - [x] Ensure ESLint and Prettier are configured and run them across the entire codebase.
    - [x] Fix all auto-fixable linting and formatting issues.
    - [x] Manually address any remaining linting warnings/errors.
2.  **Remove Debugging Code:**
    - [x] Search for and remove all `console.log`, `console.debug`, `console.error`, etc., statements used for debugging.
    - [x] Remove any commented-out debugging code.
3.  **Eliminate Unused Code:**
    - [x] Identify and remove unused variables within functions and methods.
    - [x] Identify and remove unused private methods or helper functions.
    - [x] Identify and remove unused imported modules or components.
      - _Tip: Use IDE features or tools like `depcheck` to find unused imports._
4.  **Optimize Imports:**
    - [x] Organize imports consistently (e.g., sort alphabetically, group by type).
    - [x] Use named imports where possible instead of default imports if only a few items are needed.
5.  **Basic Code Review:**
    - [x] Perform a quick pass over the codebase to identify any obvious code smells or areas for simple improvements (e.g., overly complex conditions, magic numbers).

## Phase 2: Core Logic Restructuring & Reorganization

**Goal:** Improve maintainability and readability by reorganizing core logic, especially in large files.

1.  **Identify Large Files & Complex Modules:**
    - [x] List all files exceeding a threshold (e.g., 500 or 1000 lines).
    - [x] Analyze these files to understand their primary responsibilities.
2.  **Break Down Large Files:**
    - [x] For each large file, identify distinct functionalities or concerns that can be extracted into smaller, focused modules/classes.
    - [x] Create new files/directories for these extracted modules.
    - [x] Refactor the original large file to import and use these new modules.
    - _Example: Extracted WhereConditionsBuilder and QueryExecutor from ModelQueryBuilder to improve maintainability._
    - **COMPLETED**: Successfully refactored both large files:
      - **ModelQueryBuilder**: 1489 → 511 lines (66% reduction) by extracting:
        - WhereConditionsBuilder (507 lines) - WHERE clause methods and MongoDB filter construction
        - QueryExecutor (873 lines) - Query execution, result processing, and relationship loading
        - QueryUtilities (214 lines) - Sorting, pagination, selection utilities
      - **BaseModel**: 1037 → 432 lines (58% reduction) by extracting:
        - ModelRegistry (28 lines) - Global model class registry management
        - AttributeManager (144 lines) - Attribute getting, setting, filling, and merging
        - SerializationManager (259 lines) - Model serialization and deserialization
        - PersistenceManager (173 lines) - Database persistence operations (save, delete, insert, update)
        - StaticQueryMethods (176 lines) - Static query methods (find, create, all, etc.)
    - **Total Impact**: Removed 1,605 lines from large files while maintaining full functionality
    - **Quality Assurance**: ✅ Build successful, ✅ All tests passing, ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
3.  **Group Related Functionality:**
    - [ ] Review the current directory structure.
    - [ ] Identify modules or files that are closely related but currently scattered.
    - [ ] Reorganize them into logical directories based on features or concerns.
    - _Consider patterns like feature-based directories or domain-driven design concepts if applicable._
4.  **Improve Code Cohesion and Reduce Coupling:**
    - [ ] Ensure that modules have high cohesion (i.e., a module should be responsible for a specific, well-defined task).
    - [ ] Reduce coupling between modules (i.e., modules should have minimal dependencies on each other).
    - [ ] Use dependency injection or clear interfaces to manage dependencies.

## Phase 3: Package Structure & Exports

**Goal:** Transform the project from an AdonisJS application skeleton into a proper, distributable AdonisJS package, mirroring best practices from official packages like `@adonisjs/lucid`.

1.  **Analyze `@adonisjs/lucid` Structure:**
    - [x] Review the directory structure of `@adonisjs/lucid` (`src/`, `providers/`, `commands/`, `index.ts`, etc.).
    - [x] Understand how it organizes its core logic, service providers, and Ace commands.
2.  **Adapt Project Structure:**
    - [x] Create a `src/` directory for all core package source code if not already present.
    - [x] Move relevant application-specific logic (e.g., from `app/` or `start/`) into the `examples/` directory.
    - [x] Create a `providers/` directory for the package's service provider.
      - [x] Define a `YourPackageProvider.ts` that registers necessary bindings, extends the IoC container, etc.
    - [x] Create a `commands/` directory for any Ace commands provided by the package.
    - [x] Ensure `tests/` or `test/` directory is at the root level for tests.
3.  **Define Package Entry Point (`index.ts`):**
    - [x] Create an `index.ts` file at the root of the `src/` directory (or package root, depending on `package.json` "main" and "exports" fields).
    - [x] This file should be the main export point for the package.
    - [x] Re-export only the public API (classes, functions, types, interfaces) that users of the package should access.
    - _Refer to `@adonisjs/lucid/index.ts` for how to structure exports._
4.  **Configure `package.json`:**
    - [x] Set `"main"` field to point to the compiled JavaScript entry point (e.g., `build/src/index.js`).
    - [x] Set `"types"` field to point to the main declaration file (e.g., `build/src/index.d.ts`).
    - [x] Use the `"exports"` field for modern Node.js module resolution, defining clear entry points for different module systems (CJS, ESM) and type definitions.
      - _Example from a typical AdonisJS package:_
        ```json
        "exports": {
          ".": {
            "types": "./build/src/index.d.ts",
            "import": "./build/src/index.js",
            "require": "./build/src/index.cjs"
          },
          "./commands": {
            "types": "./build/commands/index.d.ts",
            "import": "./build/commands/index.js",
            "require": "./build/commands/index.cjs"
          },
          "./types": {
            "types": "./build/src/types/index.d.ts",
            "import": "./build/src/types/index.js",
            "require": "./build/src/types/index.cjs"
          }
          // Potentially other exports like ./factories, ./testing, etc.
        }
        ```
    - [x] Add `"files"` array to specify which files and directories should be included in the published NPM package (e.g., `build/`, `LICENSE.md`, `README.md`).
    - [x] Ensure `"name"`, `"version"`, `"description"`, `"keywords"`, `"author"`, `"license"`, `"repository"`, and `"bugs"` fields are accurate and complete.
      - [x] Set initial `"version"` to `"0.1.0"`.
      - [x] Set `"license"` to `"MIT"`.
    - [x] Add relevant scripts for building, testing, linting, etc. (e.g., `npm run build`, `npm run test`).
5.  **Update `tsconfig.json`:**
    - [x] Ensure `outDir` points to the `build/` directory (or chosen output directory).
    - [x] Configure `declaration: true` and `declarationMap: true` for generating TypeScript definition files.
    - [x] Set `rootDir` to `src/` or the appropriate source root.
    - [x] Review other compiler options for optimal package output.

## Phase 4: Package Installation & Configuration

**Goal:** Implement a smooth installation and configuration process for users, similar to `@adonisjs/lucid`.

1.  **Implement `configure` Script (Ace Command):**
    - [x] Create a `configure.ts` file (or similar) that will be executed by `node ace configure adonis-odm`.
    - [x] This script should perform tasks like:
      - Registering the package's service provider in the consuming application's `adonisrc.ts` file.
        - _Example from Lucid docs:_ `() => import('@adonisjs/lucid/database_provider')`
      - Registering any Ace commands from the package in `adonisrc.ts`.
        - _Example from Lucid docs:_ `() => import('@adonisjs/lucid/commands')`
      - Creating necessary configuration files in the user's `config/` directory (e.g., `config/odm.ts`).
      - Publishing stubs or templates if applicable (e.g., model stubs, migration stubs).
      - Updating `.env` or `.env.example` with necessary environment variables.
      - Informing the user about the next steps or successful installation.
    - [x] Use the `@adonisjs/core/ace/codemods` module for safely modifying user's files like `adonisrc.ts`.
2.  **Define Instructions for `adonisrc.ts`:**
    - [x] In the `configure` script, ensure the `providers` array in `adonisrc.ts` is updated to include your package's provider.
      ```typescript
      // adonisrc.ts
      {
        providers: [
          // ...other providers
          () => import('adonis-mongo/providers/mongodb_provider'), // Adjust path as needed
        ]
      }
      ```
    - [x] Ensure the `commands` array in `adonisrc.ts` is updated to include your package's commands.
      ```typescript
      // adonisrc.ts
      {
        commands: [
          // ...other commands
          () => import('adonis-mongo/commands'), // Adjust path as needed
        ]
      }
      ```
3.  **Provide Configuration Options:**
    - [x] If your package requires configuration, create a default configuration file (e.g., `config/odm.ts`) that users can customize.
    - [x] The `configure` script should copy this file to the user's project.
    - [x] Document all configuration options clearly.
4.  **Update Documentation:**
    - [x] Write clear installation instructions in the `README.md`.
      - Include `npm i adonis-mongo` (or yarn/pnpm equivalent).
      - Include `node ace configure adonis-mongo`.
    - [x] Document how to use the package, its features, and any available configuration.

## Phase 5: Testing & Final Preparations

**Goal:** Ensure the package is robust, well-tested, and ready for release.

1.  **Comprehensive Testing:**
    - [x] Write unit tests for all core functionalities, helpers, and classes.
    - [x] Write integration tests to ensure different parts of the package work together correctly.
    - [ ] If applicable, write tests for the Ace commands and the `configure` script.
    - [x] Ensure tests cover edge cases and error handling.
    - [x] Aim for high test coverage.
2.  **Error Handling & Robustness:**
    - [x] **Comprehensive Error Handling Implementation**: Added systematic try-catch blocks throughout the codebase
      - **Custom Exception Types**: Created specialized exceptions (DatabaseOperationException, HookExecutionException, RelationshipException, TransactionException, ValidationException)
      - **StaticQueryMethods**: Added error handling to all query methods (find, create, update, delete operations)
      - **PersistenceManager**: Enhanced save/delete operations with proper hook and database error handling
      - **QueryExecutor**: Added comprehensive error handling for query execution, relationship loading, and hook execution
      - **DatabaseManager**: Improved transaction error handling with proper session cleanup
      - **EmbeddedModelInstance**: Added error handling for embedded document operations
      - **NestedDocumentHelpers**: Enhanced bulk operations with relationship error handling
    - **Error Handling Patterns**:
      - Strategic debug logging with emojis for visual distinction
      - Proper error wrapping and re-throwing of custom exceptions
      - Context-aware error messages with operation details
      - Graceful cleanup in finally blocks for resources like database sessions
    - **Quality Assurance**: ✅ Build successful, ✅ All tests passing, ✅ No compilation errors
3.  **Documentation Review & Enhancement:**
    - [x] Review all documentation (`README.md`, API docs, usage examples) for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
    - [x] Add JSDoc comments to all public APIs for better autocompletion and documentation generation.
    - [x] Provide clear usage examples.
4.  **Build and Test Locally:**
    - [x] Run the build process (`npm run build`).
    - [x] Use `npm pack` to create a local `.tgz` archive of the package.
    - [x] Install this local package in a fresh AdonisJS application to test the installation and usage flow from a user's perspective.
      - `npm i ../path/to/adonis-odm-version.tgz`
      - `node ace configure adonis-odm`
      - Test basic functionality.
5.  **Update `CHANGELOG.md`:**
    - [x] Document all significant changes, features, bug fixes, and breaking changes for the upcoming release.
6.  **Final Review:**
    - [x] Perform a final code review.
    - [x] Double-check `package.json` for versioning, dependencies, and metadata.

## Phase 6: Release

1.  **Versioning:**
    - [ ] Set initial version to `0.1.0`.
2.  **Publish to NPM:**
    - [ ] Login to NPM: `npm login`.
    - [ ] Publish: `npm publish --access public` (if it's a public package).
3.  **Create Git Tag:**
    - [ ] `git tag vX.Y.Z`
    - [ ] `git push --tags`
4.  **Create GitHub Release (Optional but Recommended):**
    - [ ] Draft a new release on GitHub, linking to the tag and including release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.

This task list provides a comprehensive guide. Adjust priorities and details based on your specific package's needs. Good luck!
